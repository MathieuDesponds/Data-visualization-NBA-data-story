# Milestone 2

## Visualization 1
The goal of the visualization is to show the travels of the different teams during the season. See the number of kilometers it travels and if we have time the impact it can have on the results.

### Sketch

### Tools needed
- Lecture 1.2 for css and svg shapes in particular for lines and transforamtions
- Lecture 4.2 for D3.js
- Lecture 5.2 for the animation of the travels of the different teams
- Lecture 6.1 for the colors we use, so that the movement on the map are very clear
- Lecture 8.2 for d3-geo


### Different pieces
#### MVP
- Team selector : load the teams in the database and put checkboxes for each of them. Then if the team is selected add it to the header
- Year selector : add a selector button with the different years to chosen
- Timeline of the season by teams : by teams load the location of their match during the season.
- Map : use the [tutorial](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/) to draw a map of the US and Canada. Add the labels of the teams on the map with their logo. Make the teams move on the map. Add the kilometers it has moved.
#### Additional features
- Show the link between the numbers of kilometers by the number of points or the ranks it gained/lost during the last period of time.
