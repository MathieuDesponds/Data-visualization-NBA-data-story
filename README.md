# Study of the NBA data by Lebron Jenkins team

In a world of hardship and division, sport achieves an incredible goal: it brings everyone together! In the United States, the basketball league, the NBA, is very popular. Teams play all year long in intense seasons, and fans get to witness careers and even legends being made. Some names such as Lebron James or Kobe Bryant are known even to non-believers as international sports icons! 


The competition for the top is fierce, and very well documented!
For our project, we use data distributed by kaggle.com and made available by the NBA itself on their official website. Details about every match, team and season are available, going back all the way to 2003! Faced with the richness of this data, how can we resist looking for unforeseen success factors in our own sciency way?

With some prior data manipulation, we expect to allow users to discover peculiar insights on their favorite sport. Using interactive data selection in our two first visualizations, users can focus their understanding and investigate on their own. In our third interactive tool, the users have complete freedom to construct their own team and visualize its effectiveness!
